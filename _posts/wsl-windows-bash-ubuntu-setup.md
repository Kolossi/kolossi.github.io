## WSL installation

You can find current version with `do-release-upgrade -V`, update
with just `do-release-upgrade`

Be aware it's best to install ubuntu from the windows store, and get rid of any
previous version (copy any files needed first)

Also:
- upgrade windows to latest version - see [get-latest-windows-setup.md](./get-latest-windows-setup.md)
- {windows key} -> type "ubuntu" -> run a bash shell (will update)
- do `sudo apt-get upgrade`
