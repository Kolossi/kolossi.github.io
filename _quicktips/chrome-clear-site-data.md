To clear all the data chrome has for a site:

* open dev tools (`F12`)
* go to `Application` tab
* choose `Clear storage` in the left menu bar
* click `Clear site data`

This can help when chrome has cached a redirect, cert details or other details not solved by doing a simple cookie clear with [EditThisCookie](http://www.editthiscookie.com/) plugin.
