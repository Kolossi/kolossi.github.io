## Why Kolossi?

Kolossi is a village in the south of Cyprus, to the south-west of which is situated [Kolossi Castle](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolossi_Castle).

I was fortunate enough to live near this as a child, and admired the fort's ruggedness and "does what it says on the tin", well, castle-ness.

Aside from the uncomplicated cuboid shape and crenellations, it had a dungeon, spiral staircase, banqueting hall, arrow slits and even an innovative [Machicolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machicolation) allowing items to be dropped or poured on any attackers.

The castle was supplied by a still visible [aquaduct](https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/aqueduct-castle-of-kolossi-near-limassol-cyprus-2001-news-photo/520722279), and next to it is an ancient [sugar refinery](http://www.mcw.gov.cy/mcw/DA/DA.nsf/All/715C0A5218C174DFC225719900331A09) and evidence of a [water mill](https://historymentor.co.uk/2020/03/25/kolossi-castle-revisited/) and [water tower](https://www.bigcyprus.com.cy/destinations/kolossi/kolossi-medieval-castle).

It has passed through the hands of the [Knights Hospitaller](https://historymentor.co.uk/2020/02/13/kolossi-castle-cyprus/), Crusaders, Knights Templars - including Richard the Lionheart - and is linked to Cyprus' famous sweet wine "Commanderia".

This was all an irresistable combination to a young boy.  So when I was older and looking for a "brand" and internet domain, I used "Kolossi Consultants".  The castle and it's story of heavy fortification, interesting history and assoctiated technology lead to the tagline "Innovation with Integrity". 

### Castle logo

The castle logo on this site is not a representation of the remaining keep at Kolossi Castle, just another simple "castle" motif.  If you look really carefully, you may also notice that the entrance and "portcullis" are actually a socket for an ethernet connector.
